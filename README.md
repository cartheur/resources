Cloudy, in here, ain't it?

### Deployment sequence criteria

THe word is: "all of them can go simultanious, but api-gateway as last one" meaning the order is up to me. Gateway obviously last, no problems. Will see.

### The Plan

Deploy in this order

* Platform-API
* Statement-API
* User-API
* Member-Portal
* Frontend
* Works-API
* API-Gateway

Check-into the keyvault script as it might prove handy at a later point in the aiventure.
